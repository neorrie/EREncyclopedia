        <h2>CLASSES</h2>
        <p>
          Elden Ring classes represent the various combat roles players can
          select during Character Creation. Each class sets the foundation for
          your initial Stats and starting Gear. This guide outlines every
          available class, detailing their stat distribution and the equipment
          they begin with.

            <h3>WHICH CLASS DO I START WITH?</h3>
            <p>
              For newcomers to Elden Ring, well-balanced classes are a solid
              choice. As a beginner, you’ll need to figure out your preferred
              playstyle, how you want to tackle challenges, and how to develop
              your character over time. While each class starts with unique
              gear, most of this equipment can be acquired later in the game
              regardless of your initial choice. What truly matters are the base
              stats and strengths, as these shape your early-game experience.
              Think about whether you enjoy melee, ranged, or magic combat, and
              choose a build that aligns with that. Remember, your starting
              class doesn’t lock you in—gear found along the way and stat
              upgrades from leveling can significantly alter how you fight.
