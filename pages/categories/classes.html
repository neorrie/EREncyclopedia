        <h2>CLASSES</h2>
        <p>
          Elden Ring classes represent the various combat roles players can
          select during Character Creation. Each class sets the foundation for
          your initial Stats and starting Gear. This guide outlines every
          available class, detailing their stat distribution and the equipment
          they begin with.

            <h3>WHICH CLASS DO I START WITH?</h3>
            <p>
              For newcomers to Elden Ring, well-balanced classes are a solid
              choice. As a beginner, you’ll need to figure out your preferred
              playstyle, how you want to tackle challenges, and how to develop
              your character over time. While each class starts with unique
              gear, most of this equipment can be acquired later in the game
              regardless of your initial choice. What truly matters are the base
              stats and strengths, as these shape your early-game experience.
              Think about whether you enjoy melee, ranged, or magic combat, and
              choose a build that aligns with that. Remember, your starting
              class doesn’t lock you in—gear found along the way and stat
              upgrades from leveling can significantly alter how you fight.
            </p>
            <h3>BUILD TIPS</h3>
            <p>
              As you explore Elden Ring, many players recommend trying out
              beginner-friendly Builds tailored to specific Attributes or
              playstyles. These pre-made setups are great for getting started,
              offering balanced approaches for melee, hybrid, or magic-focused
              characters. For example, the Vagabond offers high survivability
              and is ideal for those who want to get up close in battle. The
              Confessor provides a mix of melee and faith-based spells, perfect
              for players interested in hybrid casting. The Samurai stands out
              for its versatility and ranged options thanks to its Longbow,
              while the Astrologer caters to those who prefer casting spells
              from a distance. Players who enjoy fast-paced, aggressive combat
              might gravitate towards dual-wielding classes like those with
              curved swords. Whatever path you choose, don’t be afraid to tweak
              your Build over time to better match your evolving playstyle.
