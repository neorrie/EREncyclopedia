        <h2>CLASSES</h2>
        <p>
          In Elden Ring, your starting class determines your character’s initial
          stats and gear. Each class serves as a starting point for different
          combat styles, whether it’s close-range melee, spellcasting, or a mix
          of both. This section provides an overview of all available classes,
          their starting attributes, and their default equipment.

            <h3>WHICH CLASS DO I START WITH?</h3>
            <p>
              If you're new to Elden Ring, it's a good idea to pick a class with
              balanced stats to give yourself flexibility while learning the
              game’s systems. Your choice won’t permanently define your
              character, but it will shape your early-game experience. As you
              level up, you can adjust your stats and equip different gear,
              allowing you to move toward your preferred playstyle—be it
              melee-focused, ranged, or magic-oriented. <br /><br />Choose a
              class based on what type of gameplay you enjoy: Like fighting up
              close? Look for a class with high Strength or Vigor. Interested in
              spellcasting? A class with high Intelligence or Faith is a good
              start. Want to stay flexible? Hybrid builds or classes with
              balanced stats offer room to experiment. <br /><br />Keep in mind:
              most weapons and gear can be found later on, so your starting
              loadout isn’t permanent.
            </p>
            <h3>BUILD TIPS</h3>
            <p>
              As you explore the world, you’ll discover different playstyles
              that might appeal to you. Trying out a build tailored to your
              preferred attributes—like Strength for heavy melee or Dexterity
              for fast attacks—can help make the game more approachable. Feel
              free to evolve your build over time. The game rewards
              experimentation and adapting to what you find fun and effective.
