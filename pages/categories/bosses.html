            <h2>Bosses</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Elden Ring features a vast array of bosses that serve as key
            challenges and milestones throughout the game. Bosses range from
            major story-critical foes—such as shardbearers and demigods—to
            optional encounters hidden in dungeons, caves, and remote regions of
            the Lands Between. Each boss features unique designs, attack
            patterns, and lore connections, often acting as guardians of
            powerful items, runes, or plot progression. <br /><br />Boss fights
            are known for their intensity, cinematic presentation, and
            difficulty, often requiring players to study patterns, adapt
            strategies, and optimize builds. Many bosses can be fought solo or
            with the aid of Spirit Ashes, NPC summons, or online co-op. Some
            bosses also appear in field encounters rather than in traditional
            fog-gated arenas, contributing to the game's dynamic and
            unpredictable world.

              <h2>Types of Bosses</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              Bosses in Elden Ring are categorized by their significance,
              difficulty, and where they appear in the world. While the lines
              can blur, they generally fall into the following types:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Legendary Bosses: These are key story bosses and demigods
                central to the main narrative. Defeating them is often required
                to progress or reach specific endings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Great Enemy Bosses: Powerful foes not always tied directly to
                the main story, but still major encounters with unique arenas
                and mechanics. They often drop significant rewards.
              </li>
              <li>
                Field Bosses: Found roaming the open world or guarding key
                areas, Field Bosses can often be fought on horseback and
                sometimes respawn
              </li>
              <li>
                Dungeon Bosses: Typically found at the end of small dungeons or
                caves. They are usually easier and optional, but provide useful
                items, weapons, or upgrade materials.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evergaol Bosses: Trapped within magical arenas called Evergaols,
                these bosses offer challenging one-on-one duels and unique loot.
              </li>
