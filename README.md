# Elden Ring Encyclopedia (WIP)

A minimal web app that fetches and displays data from an Elden Ring API. Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project aims to replicate the core functionality of encyclopedic fan sites like Fextralife—presenting categorized game data in a clean, user-friendly format.

## Project Motivation

I’m a recent graduate with a strong interest in building user-friendly applications. This project was developed as part of my learning journey to deepen my frontend development skills and showcase my ability to work with RESTful APIs, handle DOM manipulation, and render dynamic content.

## Learning Outcomes I set for this project

- Get an improved understanding of working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, promises)
- Get experience in structuring HTML and styling responsive layouts
- Learn how to build apps without frameworks

## Features

- View categorized Elden Ring data (weapons, bosses, classes, etc.)
- Fetches real-time data from an external API
- Simple navigation and category-based filtering
- Clean UI inspired by game wikis

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
