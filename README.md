Elden Ring Encyclopedia (WIP)
A minimal, responsive web app that fetches and displays data from an Elden Ring API. Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project aims to replicate the core functionality of encyclopedic fan sites like Fextralife—presenting categorized game data in a clean, user-friendly format.

💡 Project Motivation
I'm a recent graduate with a passion for building user-friendly applications. This project is part of my learning journey as I explore opportunities in frontend and full-stack development.
I created this project to strengthen my frontend development skills and demonstrate my ability to work with RESTful APIs, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content rendering. It's part of my portfolio as I prepare to apply for software development internships and entry-level roles.

📚 Learning Outcomes I set for this project
- Improved understanding of working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript (fetch, promises)
- Experience in structuring HTML and styling responsive layouts
- Learned how to manage and render dynamic content without frameworks

⚙️ Features
- View categorized Elden Ring data (weapons, bosses, classes, etc.)
- Fetches real-time data from an external API
- Simple navigation and category-based filtering
- Clean UI inspired by game wikis

🛠️ Technologies Used
